# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Forecast App (Full Stack)

A full-stack weather forecasting app built with **React (TypeScript + Vite)** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express + MongoDB** on the backend. The backend acts as a proxy to the [meteo.lt](https://api.meteo.lt) API and also logs city view activity in a MongoDB database.
